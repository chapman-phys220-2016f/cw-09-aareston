**Due date:** 2016/11/01

## Specification

This week, you will explore the differences between ```python/numpy```, the up-and-coming scientific programming language ```julia```, and the established industry language ```MATLAB```.

1. Revisit the [Julia Overview Slides](http://slides.com/profdressel/julia-overview/). These slides describe how to create a complex plane as a 2-dimensional matrix of complex values, then map a function "julia" over this plane to convert it into a 2-dimensional matrix of positive integers, and finally to plot those integers as a heatmap to get a julia set. Your task this week will be to figure out how to do the same thing in MATLAB.
1. Use the following resources from the info respository to quickly assess the similarities between Python, Julia, and MATLAB:
  * [Learn Matlab in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/matlab/)
  * [Python vs. MATLAB](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)
  * [MATLAB Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/)
  * [MATLAB-Python Dictionary](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html)
  * [MATLAB-Julia-Python-R Comparison](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_matrix_cheatsheet.html)
1. In particular, you should find that the syntax for ```matplotlib``` in Python is almost identical to the syntax for plotting in MATLAB. Similarly, the array notation in Julia is almost identical to the matrix notation in MATLAB. These similarities should let you code up a solution relatively easily, based on the content of the Julia slides alone.
1. Place your solution in a MATLAB script file ```juliaset.m```. Note that every MATLAB function should also be in its own file (e.g., ```julia.m```).
